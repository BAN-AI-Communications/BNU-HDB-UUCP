	DESCRIPTION: ct does not allow remote terminal to connect properly 

	FIX/DISCUSSION:
	Since uugetty waits for 60 seconds for /usr/spool/locks/LCK.xxx
	to be removed before it kills itself and letting init respawn a
	new uugetty, ct must wait for approximately 65 seconds for the
	above mechanism to complete before exiting.

	FILES:
	usr/src/cmd/ct/ct.c

	RELEASE NOTE: (Document one or more of the following.)
no release note required because:
ENHANCEMENT:  
PROBLEM_FIX:  
TECHNOTE:   
	The following describes the setup required to provide environment
	for ct to operate properly. Assume that /dev/tty15 is the tty port for
	dial in and out.
	1. /usr/lib/uucp/Devices must have the following entries:
	  ACU	tty15 - 1200 hayes
	  Direct tty15- 1200 hayes
	2. /usr/lib/uucp/Dialers should have an entry describing the protocol
	for the type of modem being used by the system.
	3. The script file invoking ct is as follows:
	    sleep 30	# allow remote user to exit completely
	    ct -x9 -h -s2400 <phone no of remote modem> #example uses 2400 baud
	4. remote user should wait 1 minute before hitting carriage return at
	   the 'Hit carriage return' prompt.
	5. In /etc/inittab, it should be set up that uugetty be run on tty15.
	   i.e. b7::respawn:/usr/lib/uucp/uugetty -r -t120 tty15 2400
